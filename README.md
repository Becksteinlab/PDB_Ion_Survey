# Protein Ion Coordination Survey

As part of the [BioXFEL Ed Scientific Villages at ASU](https://www.bioxfel.org/education/high-school-learning-communities) program, [@kaceyreidy](https://github.com/kaceyreidy) is building a reusable data acquisition and analysis pipeline to characterize the interactions between ions and proteins. 

The input data are crystal structures from the [Protein Databank](http://www.pdb.org). [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org) is used to analyze the data. The initial focus is on a statistical analysis of the coordination numbers of ions, in particular oxygen-cation interactions.
